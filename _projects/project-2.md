We analyzed a dataset provided by the Department of Surgery at USC’s Keck School of Medicine, so as to identify features associated with graft survival after orthotopic liver transplantation. Neural networks and SVM were utilized to predict graft survival after Orthotopic liver transplantation using pre-transplant features. The machine learning algorithms were implemented with Python and Keras library.
