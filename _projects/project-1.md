We visualized military expenditures of top-10 spenders, information concerning militarized interstate disputes, wars, and international trade using datasets provided by the Correlates of Wars. A chart demonstrates the relationship between the number of countries at war and the total amount of international trade. We designed and developed the web application on Node.js, and front-end interface using Angular written in JavaScript and Bootstrap CSS framework. The responsive and interactive charts were implemented with D3.js to discover data features.
