* I am a Research Data Scientist at the Centre for AI Research and Education, Department of Computational Biomedicine, [Cedars-Sinai Medical Center](https://www.cedars-sinai.org/). My research focuses on deep learning, machine learning, and large language models applied to biomedical and clinical data. [[Resume](http://hyunjuna.github.io/files/RESUME_CHJ_102225.pdf)]

* My interests include deep learning for physiological time-series data, synthetic data generation for clinical applications, knowledge graph-enhanced LLM reasoning, and automated machine learning.

* I hold two Master's degrees in Computer Science (2022) and Data Informatics (2018) from the [University of Southern California](https://www.usc.edu/), and a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from [Inha University](http://eng.inha.ac.kr/mbshome/mbs/eng/index.do) (2016).
